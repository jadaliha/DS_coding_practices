    "# Why avoid Jupyter Notebooks for production code?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://blog-c7ff.kxcdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/butters.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons why some people may choose to avoid using Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty in reproducibility: Jupyter Notebooks can make it difficult to reproduce the results of a analysis, since the code is interspersed with markdown text and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of version control: Jupyter Notebooks are not well-suited for version control systems like Git, making it difficult to track changes and collaborate with others on a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Execution order: Jupyter Notebooks do not enforce a specific execution order for cells, which can lead to confusion and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not suitable for production: Jupyter Notebooks are not typically used in production environments, as they are not well-suited for running long-running, batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large and complex files: Jupyter Notebook files can become very large and complex, making them difficult to navigate and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool for data exploration, prototyping and education, and their benefits may outweigh the drawbacks depending on the use case."
